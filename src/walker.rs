//! Common object traversal structures for AWS S3.

//! This module doesn't contain anything special beyond a pseudo-iterator
//! to walk over objects in S3 in a more idiomatic manner. At some point
//! (hopefully soon) this will change to use an asynchronous `Stream`,
//! when Rusoto migrates to Futures 0.3 and beyond.

/// easily. Instead, this pattern must be used:
///
/// ```rust
/// let walker = ObjectWalker::new(...);
///
/// while let Some(object) = walker.next()? {
///     // do something...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Even though this isn't as convenient as `for`, it's still much
/// cleaner than manually iterating the S3 object pages.
